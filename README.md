# CQRS
Project using CQRS architecture to build event-driven microservices.

The Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern where the main focus is to separate the way of reading and writing data. 
This pattern uses two separate models: 
- Queries — responsible for reading data. 
- Commands — responsible for update data.
